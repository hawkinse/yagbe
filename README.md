# Yagbe #

Yagbe (Yet Another Gameboy Emulator) is an emulator for the original 1989 Nintendo Gameboy written in C++, with SDL 2 for input and rendering. It currently can run some games without sound or link cable support. Games can be ran by themselves, or with a DMG/MGB boot rom for slightly higher compatibility.
